UBER ANALYSIS


   This project dives into Uber's operational data using SQL analysis across three
    datasets: passengers, drivers, and rides. The scripts explore various aspects,
    including identifying unique pickup locations, assessing driver ratings, and
    examining the extent of driver operations across different areas. By leveraging
    these analyses, the project delivers key insights into the ride-sharing dynamics,
    highlighting patterns in driver performance and customer interactions within
    the Uber platform.
